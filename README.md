# 🏳️‍⚧️ LunaCraft 🚀
A framework for handling the creation, management, and serving of a Minecraft server.

---

## Why?
Honestly, no specific reason.

I could have downloaded an existing manager online, but I wanted to screw around and see how it typically works, and try my own ideas.

Plus, it also gave me an excuse to start practising more **TypeScript**, which is a plus.

## Features
- [x] Jar version manager (PaperMC)
- [x] Support for multiple MC versions
- [x] Build override (PaperMC)
- [ ] Plugin management (auto-updates, etc)
